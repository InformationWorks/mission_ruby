About Compiler and interpreter

Compiler and interpreter both are programs that have roles of bridge between high level language and machine level language. So both serve same purpose but uses different approaches.
Compiler go through the entire code, converts entire file into an intermediate code which is then used to execute. For example when a C file is compiled, an Object file is generated by Compiler and that .o file is used for execution. In this approach, it takes time when it go through entire code and convert it. But once intermediate code is generated all further execution take place on bases of intermediate code. So execution is faster until the source code is changed. 
Interpreter works per line instead of entire code, means it execute entire code line by line. It translate first line of code and execute it, and then do same with next line and continues till last line. It works till entire execution. Where else compiler goes out of picture after intermediate code is generated.  When interpreter encounters any error in code, it terminates it’s work from that line.
