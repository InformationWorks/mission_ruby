							#COMPILER:
	A compiler is a program that translates a source program written in some high-level programming language  into machine code (binary 		code) . The generated machine code can be later executed many times against different data each time.

							#INTERPRETER:
	1) Parse the source code and perform its behavior directly.
	2) Translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation and immediately execute this.
	3) Explicitly execute stored precompiled code made by compiler which is part of the interpreter system.

					#Diffrence between COMPILER and INTERPRETER:
	1) COMPILER is a piece of code that translate the whole high level language in to the machine language. INTERPRETER makes a part of 	    the high level language and Convert them into Machine language.
	2) If the Error is there than after converting whole Code the Compiler detects. But the INTERPRETER is detect error when the part of 		high level language is converting into the
